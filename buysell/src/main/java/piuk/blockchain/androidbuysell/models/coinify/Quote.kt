/**
 * Currencies are ISO_4217 Strings, eg "USD", "BTC". Coinify's API is a little strange, so the rules
 * are as follows:
 *
 * If you're sending money, eg sending 1.0 BTC in exchange for GBP, the [baseCurrency] is BTC, the
 * [quoteCurrency] is GBP and the [baseAmount] value must be negative. The [Quote.quoteAmount]
 * received in return is positive, because that's the amount you're receiving.
 *
 * If you are sending BTC in exchange for GBP and want £100 worth, [baseCurrency] is GBP,
 * [quoteCurrency] is BTC and the [baseAmount] value is positive. The corresponding
 * [Quote.baseAmount] returned will be negative, because that's the amount you'll need to send.
 *
 * @see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217].
